1. Answer these:

What does proc_write() do?
A-> - `proc_write()` handles writes to /proc entries from user space.

Why do we use copy_from_user()?
A-> `copy_from_user()` safely copies data from user space to kernel space.

What is 0666 permission for?
A-> `0666` allows read/write permissions for all users.

What happens if you don’t null-terminate the string?
A-> Missing null-termination causes buffer overflows and crashes.

What’s the difference between proc_read and seq_file?
A-> `seq_file` is preferred over `proc_read` for large outputs as it handles pagination automatically.

2. Change your writer_write() function:

If the input is "ON" → set a flag logging_enabled = 1
If the input is "OFF" → set it to 0
In writer_read(), show whether logging is ON or OFF

Hint: if (strncmp(message, "ON", 2) == 0) logging_enabled = 1;
A -> refer : Assignment/proc_write/

3. Add two /proc entries:

/proc/control — to receive commands (writeable)
/proc/status — to read current state

Example: 
echo "Start" > /proc/control
cat /proc/status
# Output: Status: Running

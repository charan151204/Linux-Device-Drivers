## 1. Short Answer Questions

1. What is the `/proc` filesystem?
A->The /proc filesystem is a virtual filesystem that provides a window into the kernel.

2. What is the purpose of `seq_printf()`?
A-> It is a helper in kernel to write output line-by-line in a memory-safe way.

3. Why do we need `proc_create()`?
A-> `proc_create()` is used to create a new entry in the `/proc` filesystem, allowing user-space programs to interact with kernel data.

4. What happens if you forget `remove_proc_entry()`?
A-> If you forget to call `remove_proc_entry()`, the proc entry will remain after your module is removed, which can lead to dangling pointers , potential kernel crashes.

5. How does `cat /proc/myinfo` fetch data from the kernel?
A-> When you run `cat /proc/myinfo`, the kernel calls the read handler of your proc entry, which executes your callback function to generate and return the data to user space.

## 2. Custom Data Display

Modify your module to show:
- System uptime (you can use `jiffies`)
- Author name from a `charp` module parameter
- A counter that increases every time the file is read

**Hint:** Use a static `int` counter and increment it inside `show_myinfo()`.

## 3. Explore Built-in `/proc` Entries

Run the following commands:

```sh
cat /proc/uptime
cat /proc/version
cat /proc/modules
cat /proc/meminfo
```

**Questions:**
1. What type of information does each file provide?
A->cpu on time -> 96581.01 289420.87

2. Which file shows all currently loaded modules?
A-> /proc/modules

3. Which file shows your kernel version?
A-> /proc/version/

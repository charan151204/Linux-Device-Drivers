1. What is the role of GRUB during boot?
GRUB's role during boot is to be the first program to run after the BIOS/UEFI, which loads the operating system kernel into memory and transfers control to it. It presents a menu that allows users to select an operating system

2. What is vmlinuz?
vmlinuz is the name of a compressed, bootable Linux kernel executable file, found in the /boot directory. When a computer starts, the bootloader loads the vmlinuz file into memory, which then decompresses itself to start the operating system by initializing hardware and launching the necessary processes

3. Why is initramfs used?
Initramfs is used as a temporary root filesystem during the Linux boot process to load the kernel modules and drivers necessary to mount the real root filesystem.

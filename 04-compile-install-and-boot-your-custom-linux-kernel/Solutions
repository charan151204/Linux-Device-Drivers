make menuconfig         : Show config menu and after creates the .config file.
make -j$(nproc)         : uses all CPU cores to speed up build
make modules_install    : Install modules
make install            : install the new kernel image and moves the necessary files to /boot
update-grub             : Updates the grub menu
uname -r                : gives the kernel version

2. After booting:

Assignments
1. Write 3–4 sentence answers:

What is a kernel module?
Why do we use printk() instead of printf()?
What does insmod do?
What is the purpose of module_init() and module_exit()?
Why should kernel modules be tested in VMs?

2. Change your module to:
Print your name and current time when loading
Print a goodbye message with module name when unloading
Hint:
Use printk(KERN_INFO "Author: <Your Name>\n");
Use #include <linux/timekeeping.h> and ktime_get_real_seconds() for time (optional)

3. Try Error Handling
Try loading the module twice — what happens?
Remove it and try removing it again — what does the kernel say?
Delete MODULE_LICENSE("GPL") and reload — what warning do you get in dmesg?

4. Write a new module called counter.c:
It maintains a counter that increases every time the module is loaded.
When removed, it shows the final count. 
This introduces you to global variables inside the kernel.
